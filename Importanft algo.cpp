//Algorithm x, x-k ;
u know k then u have to find the x-k if present there or not
//----------------------------------------------------------

//Two pointer approach
sort the array
left  and right == k 
if greater -> decrese the right as array is sorted
if smaller -> incresse left as array is sorted
